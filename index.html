<h1> <em> Welcome to my page!</em></h1>
<br>
<br>
<p1> This page is going to be a place dedicated to being all about me and all 
    the things that I am interested in. I am new to writing code especially in HTML but this project has given me confidence 
    that I will eventually be better at doing this type of work and could eventually have a career in it. 
    I am excited to continue to learn as the semester progresses.  </p1>
