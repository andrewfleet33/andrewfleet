<h1> <em><strong> Who am I?</strong></em></h1>

<p1> My name is Andrew Fleet. I am originally from Rhode Island but attended 
    College of Charleston in South Carolina. I have already recieved my B.A 
    in Marketing and Photography. I decided to make a career change only recently!<br><br> 
    I spend most of my free time in the ocean whenever possible doing any water sports I can or shooting photos. 
    I create ocean photography art and am constantly looking for new photos to shoot and print. I enjoy my time in the 
    ocean but also really enjoy meeting new people and hearing their stories. I hope I get to hear some of yours! </p1> <br>
